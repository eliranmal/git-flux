# future plans

- todo:
   - introduce an abstract notion of 'scopes', e.g. 'epic', 'team'
   - allow overriding of the base branch in the 'feature' subcommand
   - create a gitflux-survey script to hold all logic found in git-flux-init
   - talk about the option to open-source it

- document:
   - the git-flux model 'scopes' notion
   - git-flux addresses some of the issues in git-flow (e.g. we don't use `--no-ff`)
